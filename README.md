# Deep Learning School 2020 – 2021 (Advanced Course)
This repo contains most interesting homeworks from [Deep Learning School](https://www.dlschool.org).  

In my opinion, there is no sense to upload all homeworks, even the easiest ones. Instead, I'm going to upload works which go beyond the minimum course requirements – let's call it "almost-projects". I will try not only to upload notebooks but make brief descriptions and some kind of tasklists for every project.  
By the way, if you have some troubles with English (same story...) and prefer Russian, you can text me (via telegram, for example) and ask for Russian version of notebooks.

## Completed homeworks:
1. [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/paperchampion/DLS_20-21/tree/master/simple-churn-prediction) – binary classification based on [Telco dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Upcoming (or potential) homeworks:
1. Simpsons Classification (Dec '20 – Jan '21) – multiclass classification of 'The Simpsons' characters (about 42 classes – great!);
2. seq2seq, BERT, Text Summarization, audio analysis – I have no idea yet, time will tell. I hope I will have uploaded some decent CV/NLP/Audio projects by April '21 – at least one for each application.
